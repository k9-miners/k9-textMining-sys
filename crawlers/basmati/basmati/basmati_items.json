Six to 10 meters (20-33 feet) below the ocean\u2019s surface there is an array of fruits, vegetables, and herbs growing in garden beds that look remarkably like jellyfish. Here we find something that could mean a new chapter in agriculture.", "In 2012, Sergio Gamberini, the president of the ocean reef group, found himself inspired by the idea of creating an intersection between two of his passions: diving and ", "gardening", ". Since that time his team has been developing underwater biospheres that utilize the properties of the shallow ocean to grow food in a stable environment. Since their inception, these subaquatic gardens have evolved from a self-contained bed of basil with about fifty cubic liters of volume to five biospheres coming in at about two-thousand liters of volume with 26 hydroponic seed beds a piece. The project was dubbed Nemo\u2019s Garden.", "Why Would You Put a Farm Underwater?", "Well, putting a farm underwater actually solves quite a few issues that surround agriculture of the terrestrial variety. Primarily, because of the thermal insulation of the medium of the ocean, the biospheres do a particularly good job at automatically maintaining a warm, humid internal environment. The sunlight between 5 and 15 meters (16.4 and 49.2 feet) below the ocean\u2019s surface is adequate to penetrate the water and create an effect similar to traditional greenhouses but quite a bit less susceptible to environmental temperature change. The thinking behind this is that temperatures and environmental factors will become increasingly sporadic as climate change has an increasingly significant impact on weather patterns. Underwater agriculture could provide a very stable balance between temperature and light.", "The location of the biomes also makes it quite difficult for parasites and fungi to find their way into the crop. With the exception of the accidental introduction of these blights into the environment by divers (referred to as agrinauts on the Nemo\u2019s Garden website), the contained nature of the curious acrylic domes actually entirely eliminates any need to use destructive herbicides and ", "pesticides", " to preserve the crop.

This works like a distilled alcohol still, with the temperature difference causing evaporation of pure water that then condenses on the inside of the dome and trickles down into a reservoir that supplies the plants with water. Enough water, in fact, to completely supply the plants\u2014maybe even more than enough. As ocean temperatures rise, the rate of evaporation is increasing and causing occasional surpluses of fresh water in the biospheres.", "This is exciting because\u00a0", "desalination", "\u2014an increasingly important topic as global availability of fresh water continues to dwindle\u2014has traditionally been a very expensive process. Desalination via distillation, like the process used in the domes, requires an external heat source to cause evaporation. This quickly becomes a very resource intensive task. The other method (desalination via filter, aka, reverse osmosis) is proving to be more efficient, but has yet to become a cost-effective alternative to simply importing water from elsewhere. That being said, free is free, and the dome desalination process eliminates the need to dispose of the byproduct (salt), and only requires pumping to the surface to be usable.", "Limitations of Underwater Farming", "While these jellyfish\u00a0farms\u00a0certainly hold quite a bit of potential, they have a long way to go before they become a realistic and fully self-sustainable resource. The\u00a0farms, being based on a traditional hydroponic system, do require additional nutrients in order to propagate the plant population and thusly, is not a closed system agriculture solution.", "That being said, because of the immense amount of research opportunity created by the existence of these domes, pharmaceutical companies, cosmetic companies, and even Volvo has partnered with Nemo\u2019s Garden.

In addition to an intensive sensor apparatus including CO2, O2, humidity, air temperature, gyroscopic monitoring, and video monitoring, maintenance technicians must be certified divers.

Field peas fix nitrogen from the air into the soil and make it available\u00a0to\u00a0other plants. The oats in turn balance the amount of nitrogen in the soil with the amount of carbon in the soil.
