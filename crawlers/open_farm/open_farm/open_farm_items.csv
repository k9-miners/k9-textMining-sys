,Description,  Capiscum is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family Solanaceae that produces peppers. The Capiscum genus contains 20-27 species of peppers which vary in color, shape, size, and heat. 5 species are domesticated. Most peppers are green when unripe and change color as the fruit matures. The fruit of most species contains capsaicin, which gives hot peppers their spiciness. Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) are an exception: they do not contain capsaicin due to a recessive gene, and are therefore not spicy. The Scoville scale is used to measure the relative heat of peppers. Bell peppers have a rating of 0-25 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), jalapenos are between 2,500-10,000 SHU. All peppers, regardless of species, prefer a long, warm growing season and well-drained soil high in organic matter. Seeds can be started indoors 8-10 weeks before hardening off and transplanting. In cooler climates, it can be preferable to grow peppers in containers indoors to extend the growing season and prevent frost from killing plants. Peppers have an upright growing habit and can benefit from staking to help the plant support the fruits.

,Description,  Mushrooms are the fleshy, spore-bearing, fruiting body of a fungus. Mushrooms often have a stem, a cap, and gills on the underside of the cap - but not always. Commonly cultivated mushrooms include Oyster (the easiest and best for beginners), Shittake, King Stropharia or Wine Cap, Maitake, Lion's Mane, and Reishi. Mushrooms are generally grown by obtaining spores and inoculating a substrate (compost, cardboard, etc. Different types prefer different substrates) with the spores. Mushrooms can be grown indoors or outdoors, but it is often easier to cultivate them indoors because the light and moisture can be more thoroughly controlled. More growing information is available in individual species entries.

,Taxon,  Species
,Description,  Passionfruit is a perennial vine species of passion flower native to South America. Vines have large, three-lobed, dark green, slightly glossy leaves and a single, large, showy, fragrant flower on each node of new growth. Flowers are self-pollinating or pollinated by carpenter bees, and mature into a single, round to oblong, berry filled with pulpy juice and around 250 black seeds. The pulp is sweet, slightly acidic, and guava-like. There are two primary varieties of Passionfruit: purple and yellow. Yellow varieties are more tropical, produce slightly bigger and more acidic fruit, and are more frost-tender. Purple varieties are sweeter and slightly more cold-hardy. Passionfruit grows in tropical and subtropical regions and likes full sun in the morning and afternoon shade. Some purple cultivars can tolerate light frosts down to -6.6Â° C. Passionfruit can be grown indoors in containers in cooler regions. All varieties live for 5-7 years, need wind protection, and require trellising. Prune plants two years and older to encourage flower production and make harvest manageable. Passionfruit is propagated by seed, cuttings, or grafting. The seeds of hybrid varieties will not grow true to type. If starting from seed, plant seeds soon after removing them from the fruit for better germination. Seeds can be sown indoors and transplanted outside when seedlings are 25cm tall. When ripe, fruit will turn from green to deep purple or yellow and fall to the ground in a few days. Harvest fruit from the vine when it changes color or gather it from the ground. Fruit are sweetest when slightly shriveled.

,Description,  The leek is a vegetable, a cultivar of Allium ampeloprasum, the broadleaf wild leek. The edible part of the plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk. Historically, many scientific names were used for leeks, but they are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum. The name 'leek' developed from the Anglo-Saxon word ""leac"". Two closely related vegetables, elephant garlic and kurrat, are also cultivars of A. ampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food. The onion and garlic are also related, being other species of the genus Allium.
Leeks have thick blue-green foliage. The bundle of white leaf sheaths has a mild onion taste and can be blanched, steamed, braised, or grilled and used in soups, stews, omelet fillings, and more. The leaves can be used to make stock.

There are many kinds of tomatoes, including conventional, hybrid, heirloom, plum, grape, and cherry. Determinate or bush varieties do not need pruning and can be grown without trellises or cages. Indeterminate or climbing varieties benefit from pruning and should be trellised, caged, or staked.

,Description,  German, or Common Chamomile is an annual plant with daisy-like flowers. It is in the Daisy family (Asteraceae) along with Roman Chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) and the two plants have similar apple-scented flowers, but they are in separate genera. German Chamomile is taller than Roman Chamomile, growing to heights of 60cm, and produces larger flowers that are 3-5cm in diameter. It has hairless stems and is more compact than it's Roman counterpart. It's essential oil is dark blue, whereas Roman Chamomile's essential oil is pale yellow to clear. German Chamomile is the most popular source of herbal chamomile and is used to calm and nourish the nervous system and support good digestion. Chamomile attracts beneficial insects like hoverflies (which eat aphids and mites) and ladybugs. Chamomile tea can be sprayed on seedlings to prevent damping-off, a fungal infection that can kill young plants.

,Description,  Wheat is a grass that is grown for its seed. Many species of wheat make up the genus Triticum, with the most widely grown species being Common Wheat (Triticum aestivum). Wheat can be divided into two main groups: Winter (planted in fall and harvested in the spring or summer) and Spring (planted in spring and harvested in fall). Winter and Spring can then be divided into 1) Soft wheat (low in gluten, used for pastries and crackers), 2) Hard wheat (high in gluten, used for bread), and 3) Durum wheat (used for pasta). Winter wheat should be planted 6-8 weeks before the soil freezes to allow time for good root development. Spring wheat is planted as early as the ground can be worked in the spring.

,Description,  The garlic plant has a bulbous root separated into cloves and a tall stalk with branching leaves. 

The plant has two main subspecies: hard and soft neck. The choice between which subspecies to grow depends on latitude and at what point in the growing season you will be planting the crop: garlic can be day-length sensitive. Hard-neck garlic is usually grown in cooler climates and creates larger cloves. Soft-neck garlic is grown in warmer climates and produces smaller, tightly-packed cloves. 

Be sure to trim garlic scapes before they flower - this will focus the plant's energy into bulb growth, resulting in larger cloves and bulbs. Scapes have a fresh, light garlic flavor. They are delicious raw or cooked, and make a great pesto.

The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, but the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The leaves appear first, and the taproot grows more slowly beneath the soil. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months of sowing the seed. Slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months after sowing.

,Description,  The Orange is a tropical evergreen tree that produces round orange fruits, also known as ""Oranges."" Many species are self-pollinating, but having multiple trees for cross pollination can improve fruit size. Trees need temperatures between 21-32Â° C to grow properly and produce fruit. Oranges can usually withstand winter temperatures down to -6.1Â° C without experiencing damage to their leaves or trunk. Trees will bear fruit 2-3 years after transplanting.

They originated in South America, and spread to become a worldwide staple. The leaves and fruit are usually poisonous and the stem tuber is the only edible part once it is cooked. The potato can be cooked in many ways, brewed into alcohol, and also used as the basis for creating bioplastics. More growing information is available in individual species entries.

There are three main types of strawberries: 1) June-Bearing: produce a single, large crop of fruit the year after planting. To grow, transplant plugs or crowns in early spring in rows spaced at least 120cm apart. Pinch off all flowers the first season and train the plant's runners, pressing them into the soil 15-22cm apart from the mother plant. Mulch with straw or pine needles in the fall when the plants have died back. When the plants start to grow back in the spring, move the mulch aside. After harvest the second season, set a lawnmower to about 10cm high and mow, being sure not to damage crowns. The other two types are 2) Ever-bearing and 3) Day Neutral, both of which send out less runners and bear several crops of smaller fruit throughout the season. These two types can be grown using raised beds about 20cm high and 60cm wide. Transplant crowns or plugs in staggered double rows, about 30cm apart. Remove runners and flowers until July of the first year to give the roots time to develop, and then allow plants to produce fruit. All types of strawberries begin to produce fewer and less sweet fruit once they are two years or older. Because strawberries are a hybrid, seeds will not breed true. Strawberries are predominantly propagated using bare root plugs or crowns or dividing runners. Make sure not to bury the crown when transplanting plugs.

,Description,  Heirloom tomatoes are open-pollinated, non-hybrid cultivars that have usually been passed down through several generations because of valued characteristics like flavor and appearance. Heirlooms are sweeter and more richly flavored than conventional tomatoes. They come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, each with it's own unique flavor. They are often more disease-resistant, but have a shorter shelf life than conventional tomatoes. Some cultivars can be prone to cracking. Heirlooms often have a higher water content than conventional tomatoes and are often eaten raw with freshly ground salt and pepper, fresh basil, olive oil, and mozzarella.

,Description,  Cherry tomatoes range in size from a thumbtip to the size of a golf ball. Their shape ranges from spherical to slightly oblong to pointed at the bottom. They are often red, but can also be yellow, green, striped, and even black. More oblong cherry tomatoes often share characteristics with plum tomatoes, and are known as grape tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes can be quite sweet (such as the Sungold or Sunsweet yellow varieties), more traditionally acidic, or deep in flavor. They are delicious for snacking, in salads, lightly roasted or grilled, or baked. They require little to no pruning unlike larger tomato plants.
