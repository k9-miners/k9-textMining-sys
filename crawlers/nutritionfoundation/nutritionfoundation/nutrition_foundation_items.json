Although certain effects can be ascribed to probiotics as a general class, including their contribution to a healthy gut microbiotia, supporting a healthy digestive tract and a healthy immune system, many effects of probiotics are strain-specific. This means that if a certain health effect is found for one strain, no conclusions can be made on the effect of another strain, and vice versa. Probiotics do not become established members of the intestinal gut flora, so for them to confer a long-lasting benefit, they must be consumed regularly. There has been vast interest in the health benefits, which is reflected in the large number of studies now published in this field. This paper aims to consider the evidence on the effects of probiotics on health, with a focus on well-studied areas.", "Probiotics have been widely studied in people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) since a role of the microbiota in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has been implicated. Evidence from Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) suggests use of probiotics is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of symptom persistence and also significantly reduces global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating and flatulence. Combinations of probiotics are generally effective, while the role of single ", "Lactobacillus (L.)", " and ", "Bifidobacterium (B.)", " strains is unclear, possibly due to a limited number of studies.

The strain ", "Escherichia (E.) coli", " Nissle 1917 was as effective as the gold standard treatment mesalazine in maintaining remission, while the multi-strain probiotic VSL#3 taken with medication was significantly superior to placebo in improving UC disease activity. For other strains or combinations of strains the evidence is to date limited. UC sufferers who undergo surgery have a high chance of developing an infection of the artificial pouch which replaces the colon (pouchitis). The probiotic combination VSL#3 was found to be effective in maintaining remission in those suffering from chronic pouchitis, and also in lowering the risk of developing pouchitis in the first place.

Numerous studies have investigated the use of probiotics in treating acute diarrhoea, and overall were found to be effective and shorten the duration of diarrhoea by an average of one full day. The most studied probiotics are L. Rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces (S.) boulardii and Enterococcus lactic acid bacteria SF68, which were all effective.

A review found that on average use of probiotics reduced the number of patients experiencing episodes of upper respiratory tract infections by around 47% and the duration of an episode by almost 2 days. However, these findings need to be interpreted with caution due to the overall low quality and risk of bias of the included studies.", "The use of probiotics has also been studied in relation to allergies, in particular relating to atopic dermatitis (or eczema) and asthma.
