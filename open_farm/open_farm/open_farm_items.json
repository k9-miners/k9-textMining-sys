Their shape ranges from spherical to slightly oblong to pointed at the bottom. They are often red, but can also be yellow, green, striped, and even black. More oblong cherry tomatoes often share characteristics with plum tomatoes, and are known as grape tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes can be quite sweet (such as the Sungold or Sunsweet yellow varieties), more traditionally acidic, or deep in flavor. They are delicious for snacking, in salads, lightly roasted or grilled, or baked. They require little to no pruning unlike larger tomato plants.\n", "Companions", "\n              ", "\n                ", "\n                  \n                Borage\n", "            ", "Sun Requirements", "  Full Sun\n", "Growing Degree Days", "  \n", "Sowing Method", "\n            Sow seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last expected frost\n", "Spread (diameter)", "\n              45 ", "centimeters", "\n\n          ", "Row Spacing", "\n              70 ", "centimeters", "\n\n          ", "Height", "\n              60 ", "centimeters", "\n\n          "], "url": "https://openfarm.cc/en/crops/cherry-tomatoes"},

There are three main types of strawberries: 1) June-Bearing: produce a single, large crop of fruit the year after planting. To grow, transplant plugs or crowns in early spring in rows spaced at least 120cm apart. Pinch off all flowers the first season and train the plant's runners, pressing them into the soil 15-22cm apart from the mother plant. Mulch with straw or pine needles in the fall when the plants have died back. When the plants start to grow back in the spring, move the mulch aside. After harvest the second season, set a lawnmower to about 10cm high and mow, being sure not to damage crowns. The other two types are 2) Ever-bearing and 3) Day Neutral, both of which send out less runners and bear several crops of smaller fruit throughout the season. These two types can be grown using raised beds about 20cm high and 60cm wide. Transplant crowns or plugs in staggered double rows, about 30cm apart. Remove runners and flowers until July of the first year to give the roots time to develop, and then allow plants to produce fruit. All types of strawberries begin to produce fewer and less sweet fruit once they are two years or older. Because strawberries are a hybrid, seeds will not breed true. Strawberries are predominantly propagated using bare root plugs or crowns or dividing runners. Make sure not to bury the crown when transplanting plugs.\n", "Companions", "\n", "Sun Requirements", "  Full Sun\n", "Growing Degree Days", "  \n", "Sowing Method", "\n            Transplant bare root plants/plugs or divide runners\n", "Spread (diameter)", "\n              30 ", "centimeters", "\n\n          ", "Row Spacing", "\n              35 ", "centimeters", "\n\n          ", "Height", "\n              30 ", "centimeters", "\n\n          "], "url": "https://openfarm.cc/en/crops/strawberry"},

Vines have large, three-lobed, dark green, slightly glossy leaves and a single, large, showy, fragrant flower on each node of new growth. Flowers are self-pollinating or pollinated by carpenter bees, and mature into a single, round to oblong, berry filled with pulpy juice and around 250 black seeds. The pulp is sweet, slightly acidic, and guava-like. There are two primary varieties of Passionfruit: purple and yellow. Yellow varieties are more tropical, produce slightly bigger and more acidic fruit, and are more frost-tender. Purple varieties are sweeter and slightly more cold-hardy. Passionfruit grows in tropical and subtropical regions and likes full sun in the morning and afternoon shade. Some purple cultivars can tolerate light frosts down to -6.6\u00b0 C. Passionfruit can be grown indoors in containers in cooler regions. All varieties live for 5-7 years, need wind protection, and require trellising. Prune plants two years and older to encourage flower production and make harvest manageable. Passionfruit is propagated by seed, cuttings, or grafting. The seeds of hybrid varieties will not grow true to type. If starting from seed, plant seeds soon after removing them from the fruit for better germination. Seeds can be sown indoors and transplanted outside when seedlings are 25cm tall. When ripe, fruit will turn from green to deep purple or yellow and fall to the ground in a few days. Harvest fruit from the vine when it changes color or gather it from the ground. Fruit are sweetest when slightly shriveled.\n", "Companions", "\n              ", "\n                ", "\n                  \n                swiss chard\n", "                          ", "\n                ", "\n                  \n                Beets\n", "            ", "Sun Requirements", "  Full Sun\n", "Growing Degree Days", "  \n", "Sowing Method", "\n            Direct seed, cuttings, grafting\n", "Spread (diameter)", "\n              \n\n          ", "Row Spacing", "\n              300 ", "centimeters", "\n\n          ", "Height", "\n              450 ", "centimeters", "\n\n          "], "url": "https://openfarm.cc/en/crops/passion-fruit"},
